# db47 - A Simple C++ Database System

db47 is a simple database implemented in C++ that provides basic key-value storage with an emphasis on ACID properties. This project is designed as a learning project to understand the fundamentals of database operations.

## Features

- Basic key-value store
- Command line interface for getting and setting records
- Durable writes using file synchronization

## TODO

- [ ] **ACID Properties**: Discuss how db47 ensures ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) in its operations.
- [ ] **File Synchronization**: Explain the mechanism used for durable writes and file synchronization.
